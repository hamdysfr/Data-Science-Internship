# Data-Science-Internship
This repository is created by Hamideh Safari to share Golearn Tasks for data science internsip. 
It contains 4 python file and 3 dataset. The first python file is "Task0Intern.py" wich uses "Task0.csv" file as data and it ment to predict salary for a person with given years of experince,test score and interview score.
The second file "Task0-1.py" used "Tsk01Data.csv" dataset and its an implementation of linear reggression using gradient decsent.algoritem stops when relative cost in two sequence iteration be 1e-20, then return coefficient and intercept.
The third one is "Task0-2" which uses 'Tsk01Data.csv' . It's practicing of using pickle and joblib to save linear reggression model and using saved model.
Finally the last file "Task0-3" with 'Task03Data.csv' data uses pandas to create dummy variables and save it into dummies concatinate dummies to orginal data frame and drop extra column and save in a csv file.
